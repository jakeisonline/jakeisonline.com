  <p class="initial_letter">👋🏻 Hello, my name is <a href="/about">Jake Holman</a> and I've
  been solving product problems for years. I started my journey by creating a CMS for my parents
  business, then ended up leading two of <a href="/stories/zendesk">Zendesk's biggest
  products</a>. There's a lot more, but that's the short version.</p>
  <p>I take an all-encomposing approach to product development and leadership, washing
  away <a href="/stories/product-donts">previous norms</a> associated with the traditional
  product role. I believe in an approach defined as <a href="/stories/product-culture">product culture</a>.</p>
