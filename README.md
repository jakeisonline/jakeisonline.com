A static file website to talk about **me**. You're welcome. It's built on [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) and hosted by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Installation

I mean you can locally run this if you'd like, but you can just view it at [jakeisonline.com](https://www.jakeisonline.com)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jakeisonline/jakeisonline.com.git
npm install
npm run
```

## Features

* All static, no JavaScript (except for compiling)
* Fully responsive to adapt to almost all viewports
* Largely `grid`-based, a sprinkling of `flex` and very little `float`
* A [PDF version of my CV/Resume](https://www.jakeisonline.com/media/Jake%20Holman%2C%20Product%20Manager%20%26%20Leader%20-%20CV.pdf) that's just a print of the [HTML version of it](https://www.jakeisonline.com/about/cv/)
