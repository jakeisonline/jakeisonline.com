<section class="introduction">
  <p><span class="introduction__hand-wave">👋🏻</span> Hello, my name is
  <a href="/about" class="link">Jake Holman</a> and I've been solving product problems
  for years. I started my journey by creating a CMS for my parents business, then ended up
  leading two of Zendesk's biggest products. There's a lot more, but that's the short version.</p>
  <p>I take an all-encomposing approach to product development and leadership, washing
  away previous norms associated with the traditional product role. I believe in an approach
  defined as product culture.</p>
