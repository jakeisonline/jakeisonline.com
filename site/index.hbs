  <p><span class="introduction__hand-wave">👋🏻</span> Hello, my name is <a href="/about" class="link">Jake Holman</a> and I've
  been solving product problems for years. I started my journey by creating a CMS for my parents
  business, then ended up leading two of <a href="/about/zendesk" class="link">Zendesk's biggest
  products</a>. There's a lot more, but that's the short version.</p>

  away <a href="/about/product-donts" class="link">previous norms</a> associated with the traditional
  product role. I believe in an approach defined as <a href="/about/product-culture" class="link">product culture</a>.</p>
