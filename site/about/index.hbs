<section class="about__me">
  <p class="text--lede">You can call me <strong>Jake Holman</strong>. I enjoy
  finding solutions to problems we simple humans have. I combine this with a fascination
  into how people interact and generally use technology, software in particular.</p>
  <p>I believe in building a <a href="/about/product-culture" class="link link--subtle">
  strong product culture</a> throughout an organisation (not just the product team),
  working inclusively with engineering & design, and relentessly hunting down customer problems.</p>
  <p>I've been lucky enough to have created and contributed to a number of products over
  the years. I've built many dozens of features, services, and even whole platforms.</p>
  <p>I like to <a href="/about/product-donts" class="link link--subtle">challenge the traditional
  norms</a> of the product role. I have a lot of thoughts on product, product management, product
  culture and product ops.</p>
  <p>I'd love it if you wanted to <a href="/contact" class="link link--subtle">talk to me about any of that</a>.</p>
