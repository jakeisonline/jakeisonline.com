    <p class="text--lede margin--bottom-2">I enjoy
    finding solutions to problems we simple humans have. I combine this with a fascination
    into how people interact and generally use technology, software in particular.</p>
  </div>
  <p>I believe in building a strong product culture throughout an organisation (not just the product team),
  working inclusively with engineering & design, and relentessly hunting down customer problems.</p>
  <p>I've been lucky enough to have created and contributed to a number of products over
  the years. I've built many dozens of features, services, and even whole platforms.</p>
  <p>I like to challenge the traditional norms of the product role. I have a lot of thoughts
  on product, product management, product culture and product ops.</p>
  <p>I'd love it if you wanted to <a href="/contact" class="link link--subtle">talk to me about any of that</a>.</p>
